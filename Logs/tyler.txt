Remade repository to organize files better.

Started learning OpenCV to setup camera for project.


5-3-24
Began outline of the camera.py file.
Contains a function to turn camera on and a funtion to turn it off. Also a function for saving an image.

Met with group, and after talking about it. We will no longer use a camera as we cannot figure out how it works.
Instead we will be using a search bar to search animals, another API for the images of the animals, 
and GPIO buttons to work menus. 2 buttons to go from page to page on animals that have multiple pages.
To make things easier, the development branch for this will continue with the name "cameraDevelopment" so
progress can more easily be tracked.


5-8-24
Set up wire and button layout for GPIO.
Created new branch for GPIO creation and testing that
has all of the current GUI code in it.
Will not delete cameraDevelopment branch so that what was done
there can still be seen.
Will add files that were made outside of repository to learn OpenCV
into cameraDevelopment branch so the work that was done can still be seen.
