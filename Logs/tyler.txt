Met with group, and after talking about it. We will no longer use a camera as we cannot figure out how it works.
Instead we will be using a search bar to search animals, another API for the images of the animals, 
and GPIO buttons to work menus. 2 buttons to go from page to page on animals that have multiple pages.
To make things easier, the development branch for this will continue with the name "cameraDevelopment" so
progress can more easily be tracked.
